# Milk Create

Milk Create is a re-imagining of Spotify's user experience. The design is based around the analogy of storing vinyl in old milk crates. The goal was to re-create or emulate the experience of having a tangible and personally curated record collection. While retaining all the benefits of the cheap, infinite and immediate access we have to music today. It uses Spotify's API to gain access to all the music and data one could ever ask for while using principles of design to make the user feel the charm and sense of self that comes with collecting music.
